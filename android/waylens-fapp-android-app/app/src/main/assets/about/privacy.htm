      high-performance camera, stylish steering wheel-mounted remote, and a wireless adaptor that connects to your
      vehicle’s computer. The Waylens system records and overlays real-time performance data over stunning HD video to
      capture every aspect of your drive. The system includes an innovative mobile app, cloud server and automated
      smart editing software that uses algorithms to pick out the best "Moments" from your hours of aggregated driving
      footage.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">In providing these valuable services, Waylens collects information about you, your vehicle and driving habits.
      Waylens understands that privacy is important to you, so we have, where possible, written this Privacy Policy in
      plain English. This Privacy Policy explains the details of how we collect, use, share and protect the
      information we collect from you. The capitalized, defined terms contained in this Privacy Policy are defined at
      the end of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">This Privacy Policy only applies to us and to our Agents. We cannot control what other Waylens Users do with
      any information you share on or through Waylens. Be careful with your own information and what you are willing
      to share.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">This policy applies to information we collect:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-v-7019dd0b=""><li data-v-7019dd0b="">On this website.</li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">On the Waylens camera when connected to the Internet wirelessly or through your computer.</li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">In e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and Waylens.</li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">Through mobile and desktop applications you download from this website, which provide dedicated
        non-browser-based interaction between you and Waylens.&nbsp;</li></ul> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how
      we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you should choose not to use Waylens
      products or software. By accessing or using Waylens products or website, or downloading Waylens mobile or
      desktop applications, you agree to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">Waylens reserves the right to revise and update this policy from time to time. All changes are effective
      immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of Waylens thereafter. If you are a registered
      User, we will usually notify you of any changes via email and/or by asking you to review the changes to this
      Privacy Policy or our Standard Terms &amp; Conditions the next time you login to Waylens. Your continued use of
      Waylens after the time the changes are communicated will indicate your acceptance of those revised changes, so
      please check the policy periodically for updates.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Information We Collect from You</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b=""><em data-v-7019dd0b="">Finding your Friends on Waylens:</em></strong></p> <ul data-v-7019dd0b=""><li data-v-7019dd0b="">If you choose, you can use our "Find Friends" feature to locate other people with Waylens accounts either

That includes
      anything you choose to publish, post on, or submit to Waylens. Because this kind of information can be seen by
      anyone and can be indexed by search engines, you should exercise care in what you choose to submit; make sure
      everything you submit is something you want to share with everyone. To change your privacy settings on any
      Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User
      Content may be re-shared by others.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">If you remove information that you posted to the Services, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived
      pages of the Services, or if other Users or third parties using the Services have copied or saved that

      embed externally-pointing links in their content and Users can click on those links to reach other sites and
      services. We also enable Users to share information that you provide to us, like posts and comments, with other
      services. For example, Users may share your posts on Twitter and Facebook.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">This Privacy Policy only covers information we collect. It does not cover information collected by other
      services. If you access third party services through the Services, you are responsible for reading and

        files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that control, are controlled by, or
        under common control with Waylens ("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide,
        understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including
        by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). These Affiliates will honor the choices you make
        about who can see your User Content.&nbsp;</li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device
        identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you
        ("Agents"). Our Agents will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the
        Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.&nbsp;</li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This
        information allows third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
        believe will be of most interest to you.
      </li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties.&nbsp; We may
        also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and

      or you authenticate yourself through a third-party service, like Facebook. When you authenticate through another
      site, you link that account with your Waylens account. Once the accounts are linked, we may collect and store
      personally identifying information that you have provided to that third party service if you have consented to
      having such information shared with services like us. Also, we store the email address that you provided to
      create your Waylens Account and any information you fill out on the Waylens site. We do not receive or store
      passwords for linked accounts.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">When you link your Waylens account with a third party service account, we will obtain information about you
      from that third party service. That information could include, for example, biographical information or your
      geographic location, if you have provided that information to the third party service and made it available for
      Waylens to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may store and use the information about you that
      we receive from third party services to improve and personalize the Services. As a general practice, we strongly
      urge you to make careful judgments about any personal information you disclose to internet services, including
      Waylens and any third party services you link to us.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Email Communications with Us</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We may also ask you to complete surveys that we
      use for research purposes, although you are not required to respond to them. We may also keep details of your
      visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication
      data, and the resources that you access.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">Occasionally, we may need to email you. We may need to send you some administrative information, tell you
      something important about your account or changes to our services, or update you on new policies. These
      administrative communications are considered part of the Services and your Waylens account, which you may not be
      able to opt-out from receiving. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account
      information; if you receive such an email, contact us so we investigate and take any appropriate
      action.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Camera Diagnostic Information</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">When you connect your Waylens camera to the internet, we may automatically receive certain information about
      your camera and your use of the camera, including log files, camera modes, settings, durations, error rates, and
      other usage information. We collect and use this information solely in anonymous and aggregate form, unless you
      have provided your consent to associate this information with your camera serial number. This information helps
      us to improve our products and services, troubleshoot bugs, and analyze camera errors.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Mobile Software Applications</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">When you use a Waylens mobile application we may automatically receive certain information about your mobile
      device and use of the application, including a device identifier, operating system, version, and other
      information about your mobile device as well as time spent in different portions of the Waylens mobile
      application. We monitor customer software usage to help us develop the design and layout of the mobile
      application and to improve the content to better match the interests of our Users. We may also collect different
      types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more
      specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use
      that information to customize the Services. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not
      want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other
      location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device
      manufacturer’s instructions for further details.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Information Related to Your Web Browser</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with Waylens Services.
      This information may include your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating
      system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to Waylens Services, the
      date and time of each web request you make, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we
      have placed on your web browser.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">IP Address Information</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and
      browser type, for system administration, to fight spam, malware and identity theft, and to report aggregate
      information to our advertisers, if any. We also may use it to personalize the Services for you and to generate
      aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use the Services.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Information Collected Using Cookies</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to provide you with
      a good experience when you browse Waylens website or otherwise use the Services. This also allows us to improve
      our website and delivery of Services.</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's or device’s hard drive. Waylens may use
      both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor
      aggregate usage by our Users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.
      Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you. Most internet browsers
      automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies
      or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, if you use your browser
      settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of
      Waylens. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue
      cookies as soon you visit Waylens.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Information About Your Contacts</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">When you create your Waylens account, and authenticate via a third party service like Twitter, Waylens may
      collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists associated with that linked account, so that, for
      example, we can make it easy for you to connect with your existing contacts from that service who are also using
      the Services.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Email Tracking</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">To measure the deliverability of our emails to Users, we may embed information, such as a web beacon or tag, in
      them.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">We never share information we receive from you via email unless:</p> <ul data-v-7019dd0b=""><li data-v-7019dd0b="">we have your permission to share that information; or</li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom; or</li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">that information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you.</li></ul> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">We may buy or sell business assets. In these transactions, User information is typically one of the transferred
      business assets. Likewise, if we, or substantially all of our assets, get acquired, or if we go out of business
      or enter bankruptcy, User information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third
      party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to
      use your personal information as set forth in this policy.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">We try to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal system, whether attempted by
      individuals, entities, or governments. It is our policy to insist upon jurisdiction and proper legal process for
      governmental information requests, and to contest claims we believe to be unwarranted by the law. At the same
      time, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose information as we reasonably believe is
      necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy a valid law, regulation, legal process, governmental request,
      or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Standard Terms &amp; Conditions, including
      investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or
      technical issues, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
      and the prevention of spam and malware, (iv) respond to User support requests, or (v) protect the rights,
      property, health or safety of us, our Users, any third parties or the public in general.&nbsp;</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">If you ask us to release information that we have about your account, we will do so if reasonable and not
      unduly burdensome.</p> <p data-v-7019dd0b=""><strong data-v-7019dd0b="">Our Policy Towards Children</strong></p> <p data-v-7019dd0b="">Waylens is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under 13 years of age may provide any
      personal information to or on Waylens. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.&nbsp;
      If you are under 13, do not register for or use any of the Services. If you become aware that your child has

        the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and
        use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal
        information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your

        and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
        access to your account. However, Waylens cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Waylens
        or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.&nbsp;</li> <li data-v-7019dd0b="">Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and
